# OBS7-Functions

Some matlab functions that can be used during the OBS7 exam.

Everyone can use these functions. But when you make improvements or have better functions yourself, 
it would be appreciated if you add them to this repository.

This can be done by forking this repository, passing your changes and then making a pull request.
